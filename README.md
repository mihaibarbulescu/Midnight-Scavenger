# Midnight Fetcher Bot

APPLICATION BROUGHT TO YOU BY PADDY https://x.com/PoolShamrock AND PAUL https://x.com/cwpaulm

Windows-based NextJS application for user-friendly Midnight mining. Generate wallets, manage 1+X addresses, and mine with an intuitive web interface.

When the app starts, it can keep around 10 minutes for things to fully get going. As the registration of addresses can take quite some time as they are registering in the API that has rate limiting, luckily this is a one time thing.

This app is very much in early stages and bugs will appear!

Also note this was built very quickly and possibly has many bugs. 

WE TAKE ZEROOO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS SO USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Features

- 🔐 **Easy Wallet Creation** - Generate 24-word seed phrase with one click
- 💼 **200 Mining Addresses** - Auto-generate and register addresses
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly UI** - Modern web interface with real-time updates
- ⚡ **Native Performance** - Rust-based hashing for maximum speed
- 🪟 **Windows Optimized** - One-click setup script for Windows
- 📊 **Live Dashboard** - Real-time mining statistics and solution tracking

## Development Fee

This software includes a small development fee to support ongoing maintenance and improvements, If you dont like that remove it:
- **1 solution per 24 user solutions** is mined for the developers
- why 24 is because we promise you'll do more solutions than that per day
- This is **not a fee on your rewards** - you keep all your mined solutions
- The miner simply finds one additional solution for a developer address after every 10 solutions for your addresses
- Completely transparent - dev fee solutions are clearly logged and marked separately
- Can be disabled by setting `DEV_FEE_ENABLED=false` in your `.env` file

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Internet connection

### Installation

1. **Download** this repository (or clone with git)

2. **Run Setup** - Double-click `setup.cmd` or open Command Prompt and run:
   ```cmd
   setup.cmd
   ```

3. The setup script will:
   - ✅ Check/install Node.js 20.x
   - ✅ Check/install Rust toolchain
   - ✅ Build native mining module
   - ✅ Install all dependencies
   - ✅ Build the application
   - ✅ Open your browser and start the app

4. **Access the app** at `http://localhost:3001`

### Secure the Operator API

Set a strong API token to protect the local mining controls. Create a `.env` file (if you don't already have one) and add:

```env
MINING_OPERATOR_TOKEN="generate-a-long-random-token"
```

Every request to the mining control endpoints (`/api/mining/start`, `/api/mining/stop`, `/api/mining/update-config`, `/api/mining/status`) must now include an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Without the token, the server will reject the request.

## Usage

Run: setup.cmd

On Complete navigate on browser to

http://localhost:3001

### First Time Setup

1. **Create Wallet**
   - Click "Create New Wallet"
   - Enter a strong password (min. 8 characters)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Write down your 24-word seed phrase
   - Store it safely offline (paper, secure vault)
   - ⚠️ Without this seed phrase, you cannot recover your wallet!

2. **Start Mining**
   - The app will automatically generate 200 mining addresses
   - Register all addresses (this happens automatically)
   - Click "Start Mining"
   - Monitor your progress on the dashboard

### Returning Users

1. **Load Wallet**
   - Click "Load Existing Wallet"
   - Enter your password
   - Start mining immediately

## Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Stats
- 🎯 **Challenge ID** - Current mining challenge
- ✅ **Solutions Found** - Total solutions submitted
- ⏱️ **Uptime** - Mining session duration
- 📍 **Registered Addresses** - 200 addresses ready to mine
- 📈 **Hash Rate** - Mining performance

### Controls
- ▶️ **Start Mining** - Begin mining operation
- ⏹️ **Stop Mining** - Stop current mining session
- 🔄 **Live Updates** - Real-time statistics via Server-Sent Events

## Security

### Wallet Security
- Seed phrase encrypted with password (scrypt + AES-256-GCM)
- Encrypted files stored in `secure/` directory
- Never shares seed phrase after initial display
- All signing done locally (no network transmission of keys)

### Best Practices
- ✅ Use a strong password (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- ✅ Store seed phrase offline (paper, hardware wallet)
- ✅ Never share your seed phrase with anyone
- ✅ Backup your `secure/` directory to external storage
- ❌ Never screenshot or digitally store your seed phrase

### Scale
increase the below in lib\mining\orchestrator.ts
const BATCH_SIZE = 350;
private workerThreads = 12;

increase or decrease these based on your hardware 

## Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues

**"Node.js not found"**
- Run `setup.cmd` - it will guide you to install Node.js
- Or manually install from: https://nodejs.org/

**"Rust not found"**
- Run `setup.cmd` - it will install Rust automatically
- Or manually install from: https://rustup.rs/

**"Native module build failed"**
- Ensure Visual C++ Build Tools are installed
- Rust installer should handle this automatically
- Restart your terminal after Rust installation

### Runtime Issues

**"Failed to decrypt wallet"**
- Double-check your password
- Ensure `secure/wallet-seed.json.enc` exists

**"Address registration failing"**
- Check your internet connection
- API may be rate-limiting (waits 1.5s between registrations)
- Check logs in `logs/` directory

**"Mining not starting"**
- Ensure all 200 addresses are registered
- Check if challenge is active (mining has time windows)
- Verify ROM initialization completed

## Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this on multiple computers?**
A: Yes, copy your `secure/` directory and use your password on the new machine.

**Q: What happens if I forget my password?**
A: You'll need your 24-word seed phrase to recover. Without it, the wallet is unrecoverable.

**Q: Can I change the number of addresses?**
A: Yes, modify `count` in the wallet creation request (default: 200, max: 500).

**Q: Is my seed phrase sent to the server?**
A: No. All wallet operations are local. Only public addresses and signatures are sent to the mining API.

### Logs

Check these locations for debugging:
- `logs/app.log` - Application logs
- `logs/wallet-registration-progress.log` - Address registration status
- Console output in terminal
